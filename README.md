# Wordle Clone

In this project, I used `Javascript`, `HTML` and `CSS` to recreate the famous Wordle game.

## Live Demo

You can try the game yourself at:

## How to play

You have to guess a word in a maximum of 6 tries. Each guess must be a valid 5-letter word. The color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word:

- **_Correct letters_** in the right place will turn green.
  <img src="./images/correct.png" alt="correct letter" width="40"/>
- **_Correct letters_** in the **_wrong place_** will turn yellow.
  <img src="./images/halfcorrect.png" alt="half correct letter" width="40"/>
- **_Incorrect letters_** will remain black.
  <img src="./images/wrong.png" alt="wrong letter" width="40"/>

Every day there is a new word to guess. You can share your score by pressing the notification displayed after you finish playing.
