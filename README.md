# Wordle Clone

In this project, I used `Javascript` <img src="./images/js.png" alt="javascript icon" width="15"/>, `HTML` <img src="./images/html.png" alt="HTML icon" width="15"/> and `CSS` <img src="./images/css.png" alt="CSS icon" width="15"/> to recreate the famous Wordle game.

## Live Demo

You can try the game yourself at:

## How to play

You have to guess a word in a maximum of 6 tries. Each guess must be a valid 5-letter word. The color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word:

- **_Correct letters_** in the right place will turn green.

- **_Correct letters_** in the **_wrong place_** will turn yellow.

- **_Incorrect letters_** will remain black.

  <img src="./images/wrong.png" alt="wrong letter" width="40"/>

Every day there is a new word to guess ğŸ˜€. You can share your score by pressing the notification displayed after you finish playing.

You score will be shared under this format:
